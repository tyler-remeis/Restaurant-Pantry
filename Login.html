        <p>I'm glad you found me! The purpose of this site is to act as a sort of restaurant diary that assists you in the decision making process of where to eat based on where you have been or what has been recommended. This is currently a test version built by Tyler Remeis late June 2019. Questions/comments/feedback can be sent to remeis.4@osu.edu where Tyler will kindly tell you to fuck off. Just joking, feedback is always appreciated. Please don't hesistate!</p>
